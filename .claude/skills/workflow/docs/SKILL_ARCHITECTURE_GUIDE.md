## Writing Guidelines (Progressive Disclosure Pattern)

**When adding content to this document, follow these rules to maintain token efficiency:**

### Structure Format

| Content Type | Format | Example |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| **Comparisons** | Table with columns | Orchestrator vs Worker responsibilities |
| **Criteria/Indicators** | Table with description column | When to Split Skills indicators |
| **Decision Trees** | Table with YES/NO columns | Should This Be One Skill? |
| **Examples** | Table with verdict + rationale columns | PDF Processing, Task Management |
| **References** | One-line format (source, topics, key insight) | Claude Skills Deep Dive (leehanchung.github.io) - topics. Key Insight: "quote" |
| **Workflows** | Inline arrow notation (→) | Discovery → Load Metadata → Delegate → Worker |
| **Lists** | Bullet points (NOT numbered paragraphs) | Benefits: Item 1, Item 2, Item 3 |
| **Key Takeaways** | Compact bullets with inline details | Pattern Name - Brief description (metrics, impact) |

### When Verbose Content Is Justified

**KEEP detailed examples ONLY for:**
- ❌ **Anti-patterns** - Showing what NOT to do prevents mistakes (educational value)
- 🎓 **Educational workflows** - Structure examples that demonstrate architecture principles
- ⚠️ **Common pitfalls** - Real-world mistakes with explanations

**COMPRESS everything else:**
- ✅ Definitions → one sentence
- ✅ Benefits → bullet list
- ✅ Examples → table rows
- ✅ References → one line per source

### Rationale

**Token efficiency = Faster context loading + Lower costs + Better maintainability**

Target: 400-600 lines for core principles, 600-800 lines with advanced documentation techniques (this document: 791 lines, includes 23 advanced documentation principles from 2024-2025 research).

### Readability Metrics (Flesch-Kincaid 2024)

**Targets for technical documentation:**

| Metric | Formula | Target | Tool |
|--------|---------|--------|------|
| **Reading Ease** | 206.835 - 1.015×(words/sent) - 84.6×(syll/word) | 50-60 (College) | textstat.flesch_reading_ease() |

| **Paragraph Length** | sentences/paragraph | 3-5 sentences | Manual count |

### Documentation Structure (Diátaxis)

**4 types of documentation with different goals:**

| Type | Goal | Style | Use in SKILL.md |
|------|------|-------|-----------------|
| **Tutorial** | Learning-oriented | Step-by-step with examples | Quick Start section |
| **How-to** | Task-oriented | Recipes for real problems | Workflow, Use Cases |
| **Explanation** | Understanding-oriented | Concepts, context, "why" | Architecture, Principles |
| **Reference** | Information-oriented | Technical facts, API, params | Status tables, Parameters |

**Application:** Separate SKILL.md into distinct sections by type

## Core Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle

**Definition:** Each skill should do ONE thing well, not multiple unrelated things.

**Good Examples:**
- `pdf` skill - handles PDF operations only
- `email-comms` skill - handles email composition only
- `ln-401-task-executor` - executes implementation tasks only (NOT test tasks)

**Bad Examples:**
- ❌ Skill that handles PDF processing AND email composition
- ❌ Skill that creates tasks AND updates tasks AND reviews tasks
- ❌ Skill with > 3-4 major workflow steps

**Rationale:**
- Easier to maintain and debug
- Clear scope and responsibilities
- Better reusability
- Reduces context size

### 2. Orchestrator-Worker Pattern

**Definition:** Separate coordination logic from execution logic.

**Structure:**
```
Orchestrator (Coordinator)
├── Discovers context
├── Makes decisions
├── Delegates to Workers via Skill tool
└── Manages workflow state

Workers (Executors)
├── Receive specific tasks
├── Execute single-responsibility work
└── Return results
```

**Benefits:**
- **90.2% performance improvement** on complex tasks (industry data 2024)
- Parallel processing
- Specialized expertise per worker
- Clean context management
- Easy to add new workers

**Examples in This Repository:**
- **Level 1:** `ln-400-story-executor` → coordinates full Story lifecycle
- **Level 2:** `ln-300-task-coordinator`, `ln-510-quality-coordinator` (domain orchestrators) → coordinate specific workflows, delegate to workers
- **Level 3:** `ln-402-task-reviewer`, `ln-401-task-executor`, `ln-404-test-executor`, `ln-301-task-creator`, `ln-302-task-replanner` → execute work

> [!NOTE]

> See "3-Level Hierarchy (Industry Standard)" section below for complete structure and Microsoft Scheduler Agent Supervisor Pattern reference.

### 3. Narrow Specialization

**Definition:** Skills should have focused, well-defined domains.

**Guidelines:**
- SKILL.md should be < 5000 words (~800 lines)
- Frontmatter description < 200 characters
- Clear tool scoping (only necessary tools)
- Progressive resource loading (lazy loading)

**Red Flag:** Description > 200 chars = too broad scope

**Size Targets** (reconciled with plugin standards):

| Context | SKILL.md Limit | Rationale |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **This repo (ln-XXX)** | < 800 lines | Complex orchestrators justified up to 800 |
| **Plugin skills** | < 500 lines body | Standalone skills, simpler scope (per skill-creator) |
| **Word target** | 1,500-2,000 words (ideal), <5,000 max | Per skill-development |

Move detailed content to `references/` to stay within limits.

### Description Quality Rules

| Rule | Details | Source |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Max length** | < 200 chars (this repo) / < 1024 chars (plugins) | skill-creator |
| **Format** | WHAT it does + WHEN to use (specific triggers) | skill-development |
| **Trigger phrases** | Include exact user phrases that activate skill | skill-development |
| **YAML quoting** | If description contains `:`, MUST wrap in double quotes | skill-creator |
| **Allowed fields** | name, description (+ license, allowed-tools, metadata for plugins) | skill-creator |
| **Name format** | hyphen-case, 3-64 chars, no leading/trailing hyphens | skill-creator |

**Good:** `"Orchestrates task operations. Analyzes Story, builds optimal plan (1-8 tasks), delegates to ln-301/ln-302."`
**Bad:** `Orchestrates task operations: analyzes Story` ← unquoted colon breaks YAML

### Skill Directory Structure

| Directory | Purpose | This Repo | Plugins |
|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|
| `SKILL.md` | Metadata + instructions | ✅ Required | ✅ Required |
| `diagram.html` | Mermaid workflow diagram | ✅ Required | — |
| `references/` | Docs loaded on-demand | ✅ Common | ✅ Common |
| `scripts/` | Executable utilities | — | ✅ Optional |
| `examples/` | Working code examples | — | ✅ Optional |
| `assets/` | Output files (templates, icons) | — | ✅ Optional |

**This repo convention:** `ln-XXX-name/` with `SKILL.md` + `diagram.html` + `references/`. No `scripts/`, `examples/`, `assets/` (executable code lives in target projects, not skill definitions).

## Orchestrator-Worker Pattern

### Orchestrator vs Worker Responsibilities

| Component | Should Do | Should NOT Do |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Orchestrator** | Discover context (Team ID, project info)<br>Load metadata only (ID, title, status)<br>Make routing decisions<br>Delegate via Skill tool<br>Manage workflow state<br>Handle loops and retries | Execute work directly<br>Load full descriptions<br>Contain business logic |
| **Worker** | Receive specific task<br>Load full descriptions when needed<br>Execute single-responsibility work<br>Return results/status | Make workflow decisions<br>Call other workers directly<br>Manage global state |

**Key Pattern:** Orchestrator reloads metadata after each worker completes, then re-evaluates priorities.

**Example Flow (ln-400-story-executor):**
Discovery → Load Tasks Metadata (ID, title, status) → Loop (Priority 1: To Review → ln-402-task-reviewer, Priority 2: To Rework → ln-403-task-rework, Priority 3: Todo → ln-401-task-executor, Reload after each) → Story Review

### 3-Level Hierarchy (Industry Standard)

**Industry Reference:** [Scheduler Agent Supervisor Pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/scheduler-agent-supervisor) (Microsoft Architecture Center)

This architecture follows industry-proven pattern where:
- **Scheduler** arranges workflow steps and orchestrates execution
- **Agent** encapsulates service calls and resource access
- **Supervisor** monitors status and handles failures (not implemented separately in our case)

**Our Implementation:**

| Level | Role | Responsibilities | Data Loading | Delegation | Examples |
|-------|------|------------------|--------------|------------|----------|
| **Level 0** | Meta-Orchestrator | Coordinate multiple Stories via Agent Teams (TeamCreate) | Metadata only | Agent Teams (TeamCreate + SendMessage) | `ln-1000-pipeline-orchestrator` |
| **Level 1** | Top Orchestrator | Coordinate full lifecycle workflows | Metadata only | Skill tool (shared context) | `ln-400-story-executor` |
| **Level 2** | Domain Orchestrator | Coordinate specific domain workflows | Metadata only | Skill tool or Task tool | `ln-310-story-validator`, `ln-510-quality-coordinator`, `ln-300-task-coordinator`, `ln-520-test-planner` |
| **Level 3** | Worker | Execute atomic work | FULL descriptions when needed | None (leaf) | `ln-401-task-executor`, `ln-404-test-executor`, `ln-402-task-reviewer`, `ln-301-task-creator`, etc. |

**Critical Rules:**

1. **Metadata-Only Loading (L1+L2):**
   - Orchestrators load ONLY ID, title, status, labels
   - Workers load FULL descriptions when executing work
   - Rationale: Minimize coordination, reduce token usage (saves 10,000+ tokens)

2. **Delegation via Skill Tool (L1+L2):**
   - Orchestrators delegate via async Skill tool calls
   - NO direct worker-to-worker calls
   - L2→L2 delegation ALLOWED with strict rules (see L2→L2 Delegation Rules below)

3. **Worker Specialization (L3):**
   - Single responsibility per worker
   - Load FULL data when needed
   - Return results to orchestrator

**Reference:** Microsoft Architecture Center, "Scheduler Agent Supervisor Pattern" - https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/scheduler-agent-supervisor

### L2→L2 Delegation Rules

**Context:** Level 2 orchestrators may delegate to other L2 orchestrators when domains are separate and workflow is sequential.

**Industry Precedents:**
- AWS Step Functions Nested Workflows - orchestrator steps invoke other state machines
- LangGraph Multi-Agent Supervisors - supervisor agents delegate to other supervisors
- Microsoft Scheduler Agent Pattern - schedulers can compose other schedulers for complex flows

**Rules for L2→L2 Delegation:**

| Rule | Description | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **1. Explicit Delegation** | MUST use Skill tool with explicit skill name and parameters | Prevents ambiguity, ensures audit trail |
| **2. Sequential Flow** | NO parallel L2→L2 calls - one orchestrator completes before next starts | Avoids race conditions, simplifies state management |
| **3. Domain Separation** | Orchestrators MUST have different domains (task execution vs quality validation) | Prevents circular dependencies, maintains Single Responsibility |
| **4. DAG Only** | Workflow MUST form Directed Acyclic Graph - no cycles allowed | Prevents infinite loops, ensures termination |
| **5. Documentation Mandatory** | MUST document L2→L2 call in both SKILL.md files with rationale | Maintainability, clarity for future developers |
| **6. Forward Flow Only** | Cross-category delegation MUST follow category order (0XX→1XX→2XX→3XX→4XX→5XX→6XX). **Exceptions:** (1) 0XX Shared Services may be invoked from any category; (2) Task Factories (ln-301, ln-302) may be invoked from any category | Prevents backward dependencies while allowing utility services |

**Valid L2→L2 Examples:**

| Delegating Skill | Delegated Skill | Domain Separation | Rationale |
|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| ln-400-story-executor | ln-510-quality-coordinator Pass 1 | Task execution → Story quality validation | After all tasks Done, delegate quality verification |
| ln-400-story-executor | ln-510-quality-coordinator Pass 2 | Task execution → Final approval | After test task Done, delegate final Story approval |
| ln-310-story-validator | ln-400-story-executor | Story validation (3XX) → Story execution (4XX) | After Story approved (Todo), delegate execution |

**Invalid L2→L2 Examples (Violations):**

| Delegating Skill | Delegated Skill | Violation | Why Invalid |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| ln-400-story-executor | ln-310-story-validator | Rule 6: Backward flow | 4XX → 3XX violates forward-only rule (execution cannot delegate back to validation) |
| ln-300-task-coordinator | ln-400-story-executor | Rule 4: Cycle risk | Creates potential loop (coordinator → coordinator) |

**Key Insight:** L2→L2 delegation enables workflow composition while maintaining separation of concerns. Use sparingly - prefer L2→L3 delegation when possible.

### Self-Healing Pipeline Pattern

Orchestrator automatically creates fix tasks when quality checks fail, then restarts the loop.

**Benefits:** Automatic error recovery, no manual intervention, ensures quality before completion.

### Delegation Pattern Selection

**Context:** L2 coordinators can delegate to workers using two patterns: Shared Context (direct Skill tool) or Separate Context (Task tool wrapper).

| Pattern | When to Use | Pros | Cons |
|---------|-------------|------|------|
| **Shared Context**<br>(Direct Skill tool) | Coordinator performs expensive work ONCE (MCP research, Stack detection, Epic analysis) that workers must reuse | ✅ Token efficiency (no duplication)<br>✅ Workers see full context<br>✅ Conversation history preserved | ❌ Context pollution<br>❌ No parallelization (sequential only) |
| **Separate Context**<br>(Task tool wrapper) | Coordinator only orchestrates workflow, workers are independent | ✅ Context isolation<br>✅ Parallelization possible<br>✅ Clean worker environment | ❌ Context lost between coordinator/worker<br>❌ Must pass all data via prompt |

**Decision Tree:**

| Question | YES → | NO → |
|----------|-------|------|
| Q1: Do workers audit DIFFERENT aspects requiring focus/isolation? | **Use Separate Context** | Continue |
| Q2: Does coordinator perform expensive work ONCE that ALL workers reuse? | **Use Shared Context** | Continue |
| Q3: Do workers need the SAME context (Context Store, Stack, IDEAL plan)? | **Use Shared Context** | Continue |
| Q4: Coordinator only orchestrates, workers load their own data? | **Use Separate Context** | Re-evaluate design |

**Examples from Repository:**

| Coordinator | Workers | Pattern | Rationale |
|-------------|---------|---------|-----------|
| **ln-110-project-docs-coordinator** | 5 | **Shared** | Context Store with 15+ keys gathered ONCE, all workers use SAME data |
| **ln-220-story-coordinator** | 2-3 | **Shared** | Standards Research (15-20 min) ONCE, passed to ln-221/ln-222 |
| **ln-300-task-coordinator** | 2 | **Shared** | Story AC + IDEAL plan ONCE, passed to ln-301/ln-302 |
| **ln-720-structure-migrator** | 4 | **Shared** | Structure analysis ONCE, scoped contexts per worker |
| **ln-730-devops-setup** | 3 | **Shared** | Stack detection ONCE → 3 workers (Docker, CI/CD, Env) |
| **ln-740-quality-setup** | 3 | **Shared** | Stack detection + config check ONCE → 3 workers |
| **ln-620-codebase-auditor** | 9 | **Separate** | Workers audit DIFFERENT aspects (security/build/arch) — isolation = focus |
| **ln-630-test-auditor** | 5 | **Separate** | Workers audit DIFFERENT test categories — isolation = focus |
| **ln-640-pattern-evolution-auditor** | 3 | **Separate** | Workers analyze DIFFERENT patterns — isolation = focus |
| **ln-510-quality-coordinator** | 4 | **Mixed** | ln-511 Separate (independent analysis), ln-513 Separate (agent review), ln-514/ln-510 Shared (need Gate context) |
| **ln-520-test-planner** | 3 | **Separate** | Pipeline orchestration, workers read from Linear comments |
| **ln-710-dependency-upgrader** | 3 | **Separate** | Independent package managers (npm/nuget/pip) |
| **ln-760-security-setup** | 2 | **Separate** | Independent scans (secrets/dependencies) |

**Key Decision Factors:**

| Factor | → Shared Context | → Separate Context |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Workers use **SAME context** (Context Store, Stack) | ✅ | |
| Workers audit **DIFFERENT aspects** (security/build/arch) | | ✅ |
| Need **focus + specialization** per worker | | ✅ |
| Coordinator does **expensive work ONCE** all workers reuse | ✅ | |
| Workers are **fully independent** | | ✅ |

**Anti-Pattern Warnings:**
- ❌ Task tool on coordinators with expensive shared context → 3x-9x token duplication
- ❌ Shared Context on audit workers → context pollution, lost focus on specific aspect

### Worker Result Return Patterns

How workers return results depends on the delegation pattern:

| Pattern | Mechanism | Coordinator receives | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|---------|
| **Shared Context** | Conversation continuation | Worker output appears in coordinator's context automatically | ln-300 → ln-301: task URLs, kanban updates visible in same conversation |
| **Separate Context** | Task tool return value | Single text message with worker's final output | ln-620 → ln-621: audit findings returned as structured text |
| **Status Change** | External state mutation | Coordinator reads updated state (Linear, files, kanban) after worker completes | ln-400 → ln-401: task status changes in Linear, coordinator re-reads |

**Worker output contract:**

| Delegation | Worker MUST return | Format |
|------------|-------------------|--------|
| Shared Context | Result in conversation (implicit) | Free-form — coordinator sees everything |
| Separate Context (Task tool) | Structured summary as final message | Key data: URLs, counts, verdicts, errors |
| Status Change | Updated external state | Linear status, file changes, kanban updates |

**Anti-Patterns:**
- ❌ Separate Context worker relying on coordinator to "see" intermediate steps (only final message returns)
- ❌ Shared Context worker writing results to external storage instead of conversation (unnecessary indirection)
- ❌ Coordinator not verifying worker results before proceeding to next phase

## Single Responsibility Principle

### Decision Tree: Should This Be One Skill?

| Question | YES → | NO → |
|----------|-------|------|
| Q1: Do X and Y share the same domain? | Continue | Split into 2 skills |
| Q2: Do X and Y require different tool permissions? | Split into 2 skills | Continue |
| Q3: Are X and Y used independently by users? | Split into 2 skills | Continue |
| Q4: Combining X and Y results in > 800 lines? | Split into 2 skills | Can be 1 skill |
| Q5: Skill has > 3-4 major workflow steps? | Consider orchestrator + workers | 1 skill is fine |

### Examples

| Example | Functions | Verdict | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **PDF Processing** | Read PDF, Extract tables, Create PDF, Merge PDFs | ✅ ONE skill | Same domain, same tools, used together, < 800 lines |
| **Task Management** | Analyze story, Create tasks, Update tasks, Review tasks | ❌ SPLIT into orchestrator + workers | Different responsibilities, > 3 workflow steps, can be used independently |
| **ln-300-task-coordinator (Before)** | Decompose, Create, Replan | ❌ SPLIT | Monolithic, 470 lines, violates SRP |
| **ln-300-task-coordinator (After)** | Orchestrates task operations | ✅ Orchestrator | Delegates to ln-301-task-creator, ln-302-task-replanner |

---

## When to Split Skills

### Indicators for Splitting

| Indicator | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Different Tool Requirements** | Needs different permissions for functions | File operations vs API calls |
| **Different Domains** | Unrelated purposes | PDF processing + email composition |
| **Independent User Workflows** | Invoked separately, rarely together | Create task vs Update task |
| **Size Threshold** | SKILL.md > 800 lines OR > 3-4 major workflow steps | Monolithic skills |
| **Different Models Needed** | Some functions need Opus, others Haiku | Complex reasoning vs simple tasks |

### Splitting Strategy: Orchestrator + Workers

**When to use:** Skill has coordination logic + execution logic, workers can be parallelized.

**Structure:** `x-{operation}-manager` (orchestrator) → `x-{operation}-creator`, `x-{operation}-updater`, `x-{operation}-deleter` (workers)

**Example:** `ln-300-task-coordinator` (orchestrator) → `ln-301-task-creator`, `ln-302-task-replanner`

---

## When to Combine Skills

### Indicators for Combining

| Indicator | Criteria |
|-----------|----------|
| **Common Workflow Steps** | Functions share 70%+ of workflow (read → process → write) |
| **Identical Tool Permissions** | Both functions need exactly the same tools |
| **Rarely Used Independently** | Functions almost always used together |
| **Small Total Size** | Combined SKILL.md < 500 lines, < 3 major workflow steps |

### Example: ln-321-best-practices-researcher (doc_type="adr")

**Functions:** Ask 5 questions → Generate ADR document (7 sections) → Create file in docs/adrs/

**Verdict:** ✅ ONE skill (single user workflow, common tools, small size ~120 lines, supports 3 doc types)

---

## Skill Architecture Patterns

### Pattern 1: Linear Workflow

**Use Case:** Sequential steps, no branching

**Structure:**
```
Phase 1: Input/Discovery
Phase 2: Processing
Phase 3: Validation
Phase 4: Output/Save
```

**Examples:**
- `ln-111-docs-creator` - generates documentation sequentially
- `ln-112-html-builder` - builds HTML presentation
- `ln-002-best-practices-researcher` - creates guides/manuals/ADRs/research

**Diagram Type:** `graph TD` (top-down linear)

### Pattern 2: State Machine

**Use Case:** State transitions with rules

**Structure:**
```
State 1 (Todo) → State 2 (In Progress) → State 3 (To Review) → State 4 (Done)
                                                               ↓
                                         State 5 (To Rework) ← ┘
```

**Examples:**
- `ln-401-task-executor` - moves tasks through states
- `ln-404-test-executor` - test task lifecycle
- `ln-403-task-rework` - fixes after review

**Diagram Type:** `stateDiagram-v2` or `graph TD` with state nodes

### Pattern 3: Branching Workflow

**Use Case:** Decisions with multiple paths

**Structure:**
```
Phase 1: Input
Phase 2: Decision
  ├── Path A (condition 1) → Action A
  ├── Path B (condition 2) → Action B
  └── Path C (condition 3) → Action C
Phase 3: Output
```

**Examples:**
- `ln-402-task-reviewer` - 3 verdicts (Accept/Minor Fixes/Needs Rework)
- `x-story-reviewer` - Two-pass with different paths
- `ln-300-task-coordinator` - CREATE or REPLAN mode

**Diagram Type:** `graph TD` with decision diamonds

### Pattern 4: Looping Workflow

**Use Case:** Repeat until condition met

**Structure:**
```
Phase 1: Load items
Phase 2: Process item
Phase 3: Check condition
  ├── Not done → Reload → GOTO Phase 2
  └── Done → STOP
```

**Examples:**
- `ln-400-story-executor` - loops through tasks by priority
- `ln-210-epic-coordinator` - loops through domains

**Diagram Type:** `graph TD` with loop-back arrows

### Pattern 5: Orchestrator

**Use Case:** Coordinate multiple workers

**Structure:**
```
Phase 1: Discovery
Phase 2: Load Metadata
Phase 3: Decision
Phase 4: Delegate
  ├── Worker 1 (via Skill tool)
  ├── Worker 2 (via Skill tool)
  └── Worker 3 (via Skill tool)
Phase 5: Aggregate Results
```

**Examples:**
- `ln-400-story-executor` - coordinates task workers
- `ln-300-task-coordinator` - coordinates creator/replanner

**Diagram Type:** `graph TD` with delegation nodes

## Token Efficiency

### Lazy Loading Pattern

**Problem:** Loading all data upfront wastes tokens.

**Solution:** Load metadata first (ID, title, status), full descriptions later when needed.

**Benefits:** 80-90% token reduction in orchestrator, avoids context truncation, scales to Stories with many tasks.

**Example (ln-400-story-executor):**
```
Phase 2: Load Tasks Metadata (150 tokens) - ID, title, status ONLY
Phase 3: Orchestration Loop - Delegate to worker → Worker loads FULL description → Reload metadata
```

### Progressive Resource Loading

**Pattern:** Load only what's needed for current step → Load additional data when required → Cache frequently accessed.

**Example (ln-302-task-replanner):** Load IDEAL plan → Load existing tasks ONE BY ONE (Task 1 → Compare → Decision, Task 2 → Compare → Decision) → Execute operations

**Rationale:** Prevents token overflow when comparing 10+ tasks.

## Execution Patterns: Subagents vs Agent Teams (2026)

**Source:** [Anthropic Agent Teams docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams), [Custom subagents docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents), [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents)

### Complexity Ladder (from Anthropic)

**Start simple, add complexity only when needed:**

| Level | Pattern | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Single LLM call + retrieval | Well-defined task, clear input/output |
| 2 | Prompt chaining (sequential) | Fixed subtasks, needs validation gates |
| 3 | Routing (classification) | Distinct categories needing different handling |
| 4 | Subagents (Task tool) | Parallel independent tasks, only result matters |
| 5 | Agent Teams (TeamCreate) | Complex work requiring inter-agent coordination |

**Key insight (Anthropic):** "Deploy agents only when flexibility and model-driven decision-making become essential at scale. Agents demand higher costs and risk compounding errors."

### Subagents vs Agent Teams Decision

| Dimension | Subagents (Task tool) | Agent Teams (TeamCreate) |
|-----------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Context | Own window, results return to caller | Own window, fully independent |
| Communication | Report back to parent only | Teammates message each other directly |
| Coordination | Parent manages all work | Shared task list + self-coordination |
| Token cost | Lower (results summarized) | Higher (each teammate = separate instance) |
| Nesting | Cannot spawn subagents | Cannot spawn nested teams |
| Best for | Focused tasks, only result matters | Multi-stage lifecycle, coordination needed |

**In this repository:**
- **L1-L3 hierarchy** uses Subagents (Skill tool / Task tool) — orchestrators delegate to workers within single session
- **L0 (ln-1000)** uses Agent Teams (TeamCreate) — lead coordinates independent Story workers across sessions

### Custom Subagent Configuration (2026)

Subagents are `.md` files with YAML frontmatter in `.claude/agents/`:

| Field | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `tools` | Allowlist of tools | `Read, Grep, Glob` (read-only reviewer) |
| `disallowedTools` | Denylist | `Write, Edit` (prevent modifications) |
| `model` | Model routing | `haiku` (fast/cheap), `opus` (complex), `inherit` |
| `permissionMode` | Permission level | `bypassPermissions` for automation, `plan` for read-only |
| `skills` | Preloaded skill content | Injects domain knowledge at startup |
| `memory` | Persistent memory scope | `user` (global), `project` (repo-specific) |
| `hooks` | Lifecycle hooks | `PreToolUse` for validation, `Stop` for cleanup |

**For Agent Teams runtime patterns** (hooks, heartbeat, crash detection, Windows compatibility): see [AGENT_TEAMS_PLATFORM_GUIDE.md](AGENT_TEAMS_PLATFORM_GUIDE.md).

## Task Decomposition (Agile)

### Vertical Slicing (RECOMMENDED)

**Definition:** Tasks cross ALL architectural layers (UI + API + Service + DB).

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Independent - no dependencies on other tasks
- ✅ Valuable - delivers end-to-end functionality
- ✅ Testable - can be tested in isolation
- ✅ Estimable - clear scope

**Example:**
```
Good: "Add login endpoint"
  - Includes: API endpoint + service logic + DB queries + UI form + tests

Bad: Split by layers
  - Task 1: Create DB schema
  - Task 2: Create service layer
  - Task 3: Create API endpoint
  - Task 4: Create UI
  Problem: Each task has no value until ALL are done
```

**Rationale:** Horizontal splitting creates dependencies and reduces agility.

### Horizontal Splitting (AVOID)

**Definition:** Tasks split by type of work (implementation, testing, docs).

**Problems:**
- ❌ Creates dependencies (can't test without implementation)
- ❌ No value until all slices complete
- ❌ Increases coordination overhead
- ❌ Violates INVEST criteria (Independent, Valuable)

**Example (BAD):**
```
Task 1: Implementation (login endpoint)
Task 2: Testing (login tests)
Task 3: Documentation (API docs)

Problem: Task 2 depends on Task 1, Task 3 depends on Task 1+2
```

**When Horizontal Splitting Is OK:**
- **Test tasks from test planning skill** - created AFTER manual testing of entire Story
- Rationale: Tests verify INTEGRATED functionality, not individual tasks

### Task Size Guidelines

**Optimal:** 3-5 hours (1-2 work sessions)

**Too Small (< 3h):**
- Combine with related work
- Example: "Add validation" + "Add error handling" → "Add login validation and error handling"

**Too Large (> 8h):**
- Decompose further
- Split by CRUD operations, business rules, or workflow steps

**Story Limits:**
- **Max 6 tasks per Story** (12-30 hours total)
- Rationale: Easy to estimate, track, and review; reduces scope creep

### INVEST Criteria

Every User Story should be:
- **I**ndependent - no dependencies on other stories
- **N**egotiable - details can be discussed
- **V**aluable - delivers value to users
- **E**stimable - can estimate effort
- **S**mall - fits in 1-2 sprints
- **T**estable - clear acceptance criteria

## Red Flags

### Skill Design Red Flags

| Red Flag | Problem | Solution |
|----------|---------|----------|
| SKILL.md > 800 lines | Too complex, multiple responsibilities | Split into orchestrator + workers |
| Description > 200 chars | Scope too broad or unclear | Narrow focus, split into multiple skills |
| > 3-4 major workflow steps | Monolithic design | Extract workers, use orchestrator |
| Many unrelated `allowed-tools` | Mixing concerns | Split by tool requirements |
| Constant behavior modification | Using conversation context as workaround | Use proper skill scoping |
| Orchestrator loads full descriptions | Token inefficiency | Lazy loading, delegate to workers |
| Worker makes workflow decisions | Responsibility leak | Move decision logic to orchestrator |

### Task Design Red Flags

| Red Flag | Problem | Solution |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Task split by arch layers | Horizontal splitting, no independent value | Use vertical slicing |
| Task < 3 hours | Too granular, overhead > value | Combine with related work |
| Task > 8 hours | Too large, hard to estimate/track | Decompose further |
| Story > 6 tasks | Scope creep, complexity | Split into multiple Stories |
| Implementation + Test + Docs as separate tasks | Horizontal splitting, dependencies | Include tests/docs in implementation task |

- [ ] **Returns Results**: Provides status/results to orchestrator?
- [ ] **No Workflow Decisions**: Doesn't decide what to do next?
- [ ] **No Direct Worker Calls**: Doesn't call other workers directly?

### Idempotent Operations Checklist

**Definition:** Idempotent skills can be invoked multiple times safely without data loss or unintended side effects.

**When Required:** Documentation creators, configuration generators, any skill that creates persistent files/data.

**Universal Check Pattern:**

| Check Type | Tool | Pattern | Example |
|------------|------|---------|---------|
| **File existence** | Glob | `pattern: "path/to/file.md"` | `pattern: "docs/tasks/kanban_board.md"` |
| **Directory existence** | Bash | `ls path/to/dir` | `ls docs/reference/adrs/` |
| **State tracking** | Memory | Track "created list" in Phase 1 | ln-114: tracks Phase 1.2 created files → Phase 2 edits ONLY newly created |

**Checklist:**

- [ ] **File Checks**: Does skill check file existence before creation (using Glob)?
- [ ] **Directory Checks**: Does skill check directory existence before mkdir (using ls)?
- [ ] **Preserve Existing**: Does skill skip creation if file/directory exists?
- [ ] **Critical Data Protection**: Does skill protect files with user data (kanban_board.md, CLAUDE.md)?
- [ ] **User Confirmation**: Does skill ask confirmation before overwriting generated files (presentation_final.html)?
- [ ] **State Management**: If multi-phase, does skill track created items to avoid editing existing files?
- [ ] **Clear Logging**: Does skill log "✓ X already exists, skipping" or "✓ Created X"?
- [ ] **Pre-flight Check**: If orchestrator, does it scan existing files and show "Found X / Missing Y" summary?

**Examples from Repository:**

| Skill | Idempotency Pattern | Files Protected |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **ln-113-tasks-docs-creator v4.0.0** | Critical data protection | kanban_board.md with real tasks (warns user) |
| **ln-111-project-docs-creator v1.0.0** | File existence checks + State management | CLAUDE.md, docs/README.md, standards, principles (4 root) + requirements, architecture, tech_stack + conditionals (11 files total) |
| **ln-115-presentation-creator v4.0.0** | User confirmation | Asks before rebuilding presentation_final.html (manual edits protection) |
| **ln-110-documents-pipeline v4.0.0** | Pre-flight check | Scans 24 potential files, shows "Found X / Missing Y" summary before creation |

**Benefits:** Accidental re-invocation safe, no data loss, clear user feedback, allows progressive documentation creation.

2. **Orchestrator-Worker Pattern** - Industry standard 2024-2026 (90%+ performance improvement). 4-level hierarchy: L0 (Agent Teams) → L1 (Top Orchestrator) → L2 (Domain) → L3 (Worker)

3. **Single Responsibility** - One skill = one job (< 800 lines, < 200 char description, ≤ 3-4 major workflow steps)

4. **Vertical Slicing** - Cross all layers (UI + API + Service + DB), avoid horizontal splitting

5. **Token Efficiency** - Lazy loading (orchestrators: metadata only, workers: full descriptions when needed)

6. **Subagents for isolation, Agent Teams for coordination** - Use Subagents (Task tool) when only result matters. Use Agent Teams (TeamCreate) when workers need inter-agent communication

**When in doubt:** Simple > complex, narrow specialization > monoliths, Subagents > Agent Teams (unless coordination needed).
